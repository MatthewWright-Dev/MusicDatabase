README for Music Database.

About:
Music Database is a java program built with the intention of compiling the weekly newsletters distributed by AllMusic into a databse which I can use to track and facilitate my research of newly released music. I am a lifelong music lover and audiophile, and years ago I became fond of AllMusic, the online music editorial and biographical website. This program takes a URL, parses the newsletter, and adds that weeks reviews to my database so I can keep up with new releases.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

I have included all of the required files. 

***************************
Files Included Here are:
1) AccessSQL.java         //  A java class containing methods used to interact with the .db database.
2) DataDriver.java     //  The java class containing the Main Method and all file paths.
3) DataMenus.java        //  A java class responsible for simple console menus.
***************************
I
NSTRUCTIONS:

Open DataDriver.java in an appropriate IDE. There is 1 String that will need to be modified. 
At line 15, copy the correct filepath for ReviewsDB.db. You will also have the option of inputting this path while running the program, and you can also create a new database from scratch.

Next, compile the java files.

Finally, run the main method in DataDriver.java. 

Thank you!
